the game needs to be timer-based rather than ending when the tiles reach the ceiling. unlike tetris, you need to more time to think about where you want to place a tile, and how it should be rotated, so it would feel better if you could control the pace yourself.

possible solutions to the edge problem:

1. wrap-around edges - no, too complicated I think. The solution should be visible at all times without having to manipulate the screen. It would take some time to fully grasp.
2. tapping tiles to destroy them - pros: allows you to interact with tiles directly, makes logical sense. cons: tapping the exact tile may be too cumbersome in a time-based game.
3. an erase tile that drops randomly - so if you make a mistake, you have to just survive until the next erase shows up? could work, we'll have to test that out
4. connection lines along the edges - biggest issue is that this would take up precious screen real-estate. pros: easy to understand, would make sense, could potentially allow for more strategy.

erase tiles exist that destroy tiles they touch

you can rotate, position, and drop tiles
tiles disappear when they form connections
if a tile connects to the edge, it transforms into an unconnectable tile
unconnectables disappear by touching the bottom of the screen, and earn you no points.

position a tile and set its rotation before dropping
drop tiles by pressing a button. you can drop as many tiles as you want as quickly as you want. 
no penalty for filling up the field, besides being unable to place new tiles
you have to prevent a connection meter from depleting by making connections
cannot rotate or move tiles when they're already placed
tapping a tile destroys it, but it takes some time before it can be destroyed. tap it again to undo this operation
(optional: maybe it could act like a bomb and also destroy the tiles around it)
(the only potential issue is we lose the feeling similar to tetris where, if you make a mistake, you get less space to correct it, increasing tension)
(maybe include a bomb tile that simply destroys surrounding tiles when dropped)
tiles that are destroyed when touching the bottom
see if the field spinning mechanic should stay in place or not

bonus for getting multiple rows at once, like in tetris
show the amount of turns you survived in relaxed mode
show the time you survived in arcade mode
get something special for clearing the screen. have the whole thing flash white or something
free play mode where you can place any tile wherever on the screen, maybe to create your own challenges to share? also maybe give the option to change the color of tiles, and maybe produce your own sequences to be dropped? draw a series of tiles then draw/touch in what order they should be dropped?
challenges where pieces are already on the table and must be destroyed
challenges requiring you to reach a certain score before a certain pattern of pieces finishes dropping
tell you the length of your connection, how many tiles you've captured, and when you hit streaks (destroyed tiles creating more connections)
add another meter that can be filled when in frenzy mode. frenzy squared? idk what might be acheived through this, maybe the rainbow colors/flashing backgrounds
when frenzy mode is acheived, all the tiles you destroy count towards a massive combo
score will change to words when you get a combo, or when frenzy mode is acheived
the tiles all have the same color/all colors cycle like a rainbow?
adjust colors so all have similar luminosity (so blue isn't so dark)
make red tiles/magenta tiles appear less often?
when frenzy is acheived, all the red tiles disappear and give you double points
when you encapsulate tiles, you get no points for them except for the red tiles
should different tiles give you different points for removing?
frenzy mode, unlocked after completing all challenges
mode where you have to connect tiles to tiles of similar color. either the colors or types rotate, one aspect will be randomized, so there will 
tiles you have to destroy by forming clusters with other tiles? or would that go against the spirit of the game
large tiles?
tiles that come in immovable blocks/clusters
tiles whose rotations are connected to other tiles
should we let frenzies stack? as in, should you be able to get frenzy after frenzy if you do well enough in frenzy? should we make subsequent frenzies shorter? we'll see

tiles that take up space, but can't be moved? nah you should be able to move all tiles so you dont get ones stuck in corners that cant connect to anything. the only way you should get points here is through connecting, not through clustering or having tiles hit the bottom.

-menu:
-timed
-turn-based
-versus
-challenge mode
-stats (total amount of blocks destroyed, total amount of blocks tapped, favorite block, longest play session, highest score, etc..)
-acheivements?

-pieces that pass through other pieces
-pay for no ads
-diagonal mode
-shapeout/match3 mode (field is already randomly filled, deleted tiles get replaced with more random tiles from the top)
-special tiles that can overlap/combine with other ones
-monochrome mode
-mode where you can slide the field left-right
-mode where you can't control where the blocks fall
-level where the bottom half of the screen is obscured
-mode where you can only control where the next tile drops, its rotation and nothing else
-change colors option
-completing a circuit explodes and pushes tiles upwards
-mode where tiles are all variations on 4 ports
-score limit idea, you have to beat a certain score each time you play or else you lose a life, lose 3 and you need to wait 30 minutes to replay. score limit increases the better you are at the game
-invisible mode
-mode where loops don't destroy the insides
-mode where blockades fall in (you can't move these blocks and they don't connect to anything, you can only destroy them by letting them touch the bottom or inside a circuit)
-all loops disappear

-tiles you'd have to repeatedly tap on to drop
-floating pieces
-tiles that clone themselves

weird consequences:

-i can somehow have the blocks come down in reverse to the bottom, like a ladder, rather than being stacked on top of each other
-when destroying blocks, do it top to bottom otherwise theyll be stacked at the top

optional modes:
